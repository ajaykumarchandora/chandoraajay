                                Sanskrit is a language that has had a profound impact on Indian culture and history. To
                                truly understand the richness of Indian culture and philosophy, one must have a deep
                                appreciation for Sanskrit and its many contributions to the world.Sanskrit, the ancient
                                language of India, is losing its values. This is a fact that cannot be ignored. The
                                decline of Sanskrit is a result of various factors. One of the major reasons is the lack
                                of interest among the younger generation to learn and speak Sanskrit. Sanskrit is being
                                preserved by a group of dedicated individuals. Despite the language being considered a
                                "dead" language, these people believe that it is important to keep the language alive.
                                They argue that Sanskrit is the root of many Indian languages and has a rich cultural
                                history.<br><br> In India, there are several villages that are not only preserving but
                                also promoting Sanskrit. One such village is Mattur in Karnataka. The village has made
                                Sanskrit its official language and all the residents speak it fluently. The village also
                                hosts an annual Sanskrit festival which attracts scholars from all over the country.

                            dialect called Sankethi dialect. Sankethi dialect is a combination of Classical Sanskrit,
                            Tamil, and Telugu. This dialect has no separate script. Devanagari script is used for this
                            dialect.</p>

                        <p class="articlecontent contwidth">People in this community lead a Vedic lifestyle. They read
                            ancient scriptures and communicate in Sanskrit. The language is so prevalent that everything

                        <p class="articlecontent contwidth">
                            The Sankethi Brahmin community had stopped speaking Sanskrit for a long time. In 1981, a
                            non-profit organization called Sanskrit Bharti, based in New Delhi, organized a 10-day
                            workshop to promote Sanskrit. The workshop was successful and on the last day, a ceremony
                            was held with the Prophet of Udupi Pejawar Mutt as the chief guest. Pejawar Mutt said
                            <strong>"A place where individuals speak sanskrit, where whole houses talk in sanskrit! what
                                next? A Sanskrit Village."</strong><br>
                            The words of the prophet were taken seriously by the village residents. They began promoting
                            Sanskrit in the village, resulting in the creation of a whole Sanskrit speaking community.
                            The children learned Sanskrit from the young generation who were already proficient in the
                            language. Eventually, even the older members of the village learned Sanskrit.
